I have created a snow-globe for this project. Using solid shapes and object manipulation, there is a snowman with a complete face and a Christmas tree adorned with ornaments.
There is snow falling inside the globe at random intervals and only exists inside the globe. The environment can be manipulated with the mouse by clicking and dragging.
Using the page up and page down, you can remove/add the dots making the "glass" of the globe. Using the mouse scroll, you can zoom in and out into the environment.
