I have completed all parts up to and including part 4. I was unable to get the knife to leave the player and I was unable to register player
v. player collisions. Other than those two missing features, the game is completely functional. The hero can run, jump, sprint, swing sword, throw,
and die all with their respective sounds and animation timings. Even the winning square is triggered when walked over and the
winning sound is played. Again, the only missing features are throwing knives, registering hits.
